Repository containing the integration script used to integrate the Malawi lethal Covid-19 cohort with two existing lethal Covid-19 lung autopsy cohorts. Both additional cohorts were recruited in the USA (Northern hemisphere) and published by Delorey et al (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03570-8) and Melms et al (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03569-1). 

All plots and figures were generated using scripts from the original Malawi Covid-19 preprint repository, which can be accessed here: https://github.com/olympiahardy/COSMIC_Malawi_Covid_Atlas .
