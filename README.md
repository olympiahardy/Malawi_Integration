Repository containing the integration script used to integrate the Malawi lethal Covid19 cohort with two existing lethal Covid19 lung autopsy cohorts. Both additional cohorts were recruited in the USA (Northern hemisphere) and published by Delorey et al and Melms et al. 

All plots and figures were generated using scripts from the original Malawi Covid19 preprint repository.
